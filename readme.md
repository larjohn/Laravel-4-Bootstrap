##Metamin - DBpedia Validation Errors Power Tool

The application will focus on giving tbe users a quick summary of the current state about validation tests and provide an easy way to tackle validation issues with few clicks. The users (power users of DBpedia) will be able to view aggregate information based on the errors and their metadata (e.g. how many countries have a prime minister that is dead?). The errors metadata will be editable through the application, so that the users can classify the errors and make it easier for others to navigate. The application will be designed so that it can be configured to work with other datasets and validation schemes.
